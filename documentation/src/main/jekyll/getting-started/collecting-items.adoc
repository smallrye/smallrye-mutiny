== Collecting items

There are cases where you want to accumulate the items from a `Multi` and produce a `Uni` as a final result.
This is also called a _reduction_ in functional programming.

The `Uni` fires its item when the `Multi` completes.
Mutiny provides multiple operators to deal with that scenario.
For example, you can store the items in a list, emit the list on completion, or use a Java `Collector` to customize the aggregation.

IMPORTANT: Don't collect items from infinite streams or you will likely end with an out-of-memory failure!

=== Collecting items into a list

One of the most common approaches to collect items is to store them in a list (`Uni<List<T>>`)
It emits the final list when the `Multi` completes.

How to achieve this with Mutiny?

[source, java]
----
Multi<String> multi = ...;
Uni<List<String>> uni = multi.collectItems().asList();
----

It's important to note that the returned type is a `Uni`.
It emits the list when the multi completes.

=== Collecting items into a map

You can also collect the items into a `Map`.
In this case, you need to provide a function to compute the key for each item:

[source, java]
----
Multi<String> multi = ...;
Uni<Map<String, String>> uni = 
  multi.collectItems()
    .asMap(item -> getKeyForItem(item))
----

If the key mapper function returns the same key for multiple items, the last one with that key is stored in the final `Map`.
You can collect items in a _multimap_ to handle items with the same keys.

=== Collecting items into a multimap

A multimap is a `Map<K, List<T>>.` 
In the case of a conflicting key, it stores all the items in a list associated with that key.

[source, java]
----
Multi<String> multi = ...;
Uni<Map<String, String>> uni = 
  multi.collectItems()
    .asMultiMap(item -> getKeyForItem(item));
----

=== Using a custom accumulator

You can also use a custom _accumulator_ function:

[source, java]
----
Multi<String> multi = ...;
Uni<MyCollection> uni = multi.collectItems()
  .in(MyCollection::new, (col, item) -> col.add(item));
----

The `in` method receives two arguments:

1. a supplier providing the new instance of your collection/container
2. the accumulator function

You can also use a Java `Collector`.
For example, in the next example, count the number of items, and produce the final count as item:

[source, java]
----
Uni<Long> count = multi.collectItems()
  .with(Collectors.counting());
----
