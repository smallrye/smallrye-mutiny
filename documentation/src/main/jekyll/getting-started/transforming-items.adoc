== Transforming items synchronously

Both `Unis` and `Multis` emit _items_.
One of the most common operations you will do is transforming these items using a synchronous 1-to-1 function.

To achieve this, you use `onItem().transform(Function<T, U>)`.
It calls the passed function for each item and produces the result as an item which is propagaed downstream.

=== Transforming items produced by a Uni

Let's imagine you have a `Uni<String>,` and you want to capitalize the received `String`.
Implementing this transformation is done as follows:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
Uni<String> uni = Uni.createFrom().item("hello");

uni
  .onItem().transform(i -> i.toUpperCase())    
  .subscribe().with(
    item -> System.out.println(item)); // Print HELLO 
----

=== Transforming items produced by a Multi

The only difference for `Multi` is that the function is called for each item:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
Multi<String> m = multi
  .onItem().transform(i -> i.toUpperCase());
----

The produced items are passed to the downstream subscriber:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
Multi<String> multi = Multi.createFrom().items("a", "b", "c");
multi
  .onItem().transform(i -> i.toUpperCase())
  .subscribe().with(
    item -> System.out.println(item)); // Print A B C   
----

=== What if the transformation failed?

If the transformation throws an exception, that exception is caught and passed to the downstream subscriber as a _failure_ event.
It also means that the subscriber won't get further item after that failure.

=== Chaining multiple transformations

You can chain multiple transformations:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
Uni<String> u = uni
  .onItem().transform(i -> i.toUpperCase())
  .onItem().transform(i -> i + "!");
----
