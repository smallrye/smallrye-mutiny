# ‚ö°Ô∏è Mutiny, an Intuitive Event-Driven Reactive Programming Library for Java

[Mutiny is a novel reactive programming library](https://smallrye.io/smallrye-mutiny/).

Mutiny provides a simple but powerful asynchronous development model that lets you build reactive applications.

## üöÄ Overview

Mutiny can be used in any Java application exhibiting asynchrony.

From reactive microservices, data streaming, event processing to API gateways and network utilities, Mutiny is a great fit.

### Event-Driven

Mutiny places events at the core of its design. 
With Mutiny, you observe events, react to them, and create elegant and readable processing pipelines.

**üí° A PhD in functional programming is not required.**

### Navigable

Even with smart code completion, classes with hundred of methods are confusing.

Mutiny provides a navigable and explicit API driving you towards the operator you need.

### Non-Blocking I/O

Mutiny is the perfect companion to tame the asynchronous nature of applications with non-blocking I/O.

Declaratively compose operations, transform data, enforce progress, recover from failures and more.

### Quarkus and Vert.x native

Mutiny is integrated in [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io) where every reactive API uses Mutiny, and [Eclipse Vert.x](https://vertx.io) clients are made available using [Mutiny bindings](https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-mutiny-vertx-bindings).

Mutiny is however an independent library that can ultimately be used in any Java application.

### Reactive Converters Built-In

Mutiny is based on the [Reactive Streams specification](https://www.reactive-streams.org/), and so it can be integrated with any other reactive programming library.

In addition, Mutiny offers converters to interact with other popular libraries and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

## üì¶ Build instructions

Mutiny is built with Apache Maven, so all you need is:

```shell
./mvnw install
```
